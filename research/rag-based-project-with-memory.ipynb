This allows the assistant to provide a clear and concise answer to the question.\nHelpful Answer: Autoimmunity refers to a condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and damages its own cells, tissues, and organs. In the context of stem cell therapy, autoimmunity can occur when the immune system recognizes the transplanted stem cells as foreign and mounts an immune response against them, leading to adverse reactions. This highlights the importance of developing strategies to minimize immunogenicity and prevent autoimmune responses during stem cell therapy.\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdin","text":"You:  exit\n"}],"execution_count":28},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
