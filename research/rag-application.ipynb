The therapy involves injecting stem cells into a patient's body, where they can differentiate into the desired cell type and replace damaged or diseased cells. There are several types of stem cells, including embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells. Each type of stem cell has its own unique properties and potential uses in medicine. Some of the potential applications of stem cell therapy include the treatment of orthopedic conditions, such as bone and cartilage defects, the repair of damaged heart tissue after a heart attack, and the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease.

In healthy individuals, the immune system is able to distinguish between foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, and the body's own cells and tissues. However, in people with autoimmunity, the immune system fails to make this distinction, leading to an attack on the body's own cells and tissues. There are several types of autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes. The symptoms of autoimmunity can vary depending on the specific disorder and the organs or tissues affected. Treatment options for autoimmune disorders may include medications to suppress the immune system, immunosuppressive drugs, and physical therapy.\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdin","text":"You:  reset\n"},{"name":"stdout","text":"\nðŸ”„ New context started!\n","output_type":"stream"},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdin","text":"You:  what is loan amount in loan analysis sheet\n"},{"name":"stdout","text":"Bot: Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.
